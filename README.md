Known issues:

When changing the cell size using the slider, it is not possible to set the exact size to the pixel;
==TEMPORARY SOLUTION==
Set the approximate cell size using the slider, then select the desired size using the arrows on the keyboard.

Changes are not saved after closing the program

Sometimes after installation and while the program is running, the cursor
"blinks" loading

The grid does not allow you to interact with the object under it (especially noticeable with a line width of 4 pixels)
==SOLVED==
Now the Grid is a transparent window for actions.

The grid is superimposed on the taskbar
